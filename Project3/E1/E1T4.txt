Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

InstanceProfileRole: Binding policy with c3-app-InstanceRole violates Least Privilege Access
    - Allow full access to all S3 buckets.
    - Only allow access to the S3 bucket: cand-c3-free-cooking - ****, not any other S3 bucket including cand-c3-secret-cooking - ****

# Poor practice 2
WebAppSG: Inbound rule too open
    - It only allows requests coming from ALB.
    - Direct SSH to the web application server should not be allowed
      - Use AWS system manager if necessary

# Poor practice 3
RecipeWebServiceInstance: Not in private subnet even though server is behind ALB

# Poor practice 4
S3BucketRecipesSecret: No server-side encryption, anyone with access to the account can read the data
