# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Migrate EC2 instances of web services to private subnets
- Redirect http requests to https in ALB

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- Not fully. Someone with access to the attack case can still access those S3 buckets

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, encryption will only be applied to new uploads. To encrypt existing files, they must be re-uploaded.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- All the manual changes would be reset.
