- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage : 1-2 minutes
    - In the event that your DB instance goes down as planned or unplanned, Amazon RDS will automatically switch to the backup in another Availability Zone if you have Multi-AZ enabled. The time it takes for a failover to complete depends on database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance becomes unavailable. Failover time is typically 60–120 seconds. However, large transactions or lengthy rollbacks can increase failover time
	
- Minimum RTO for a single region outage : 15-60 mins
	◦ 00:00 - In case of loss of the entire region at night
	◦ 00:03 - A period of time elapses before the warning activates
	◦ 00:05 - Staff activates an alert
	◦ 00:15 - The operator may have to get out of bed, get on the computer, log in, log on to the VPN
	◦ 00:25 - The operator begins to diagnose the problem
	◦ 00:40 - Root cause discovered
	◦ 00:46 - A support staff needs to manually promote the read replica in the secondary region to the primary database, updating the application's DB url with the new one.
	◦ 00:55 - Repair completed

- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage : 0 mins
	- With the Multi-AZ configuration, we have a synchronous standby copy of the main database, so there is no data loss.

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage : 0 mins
	- Since we have a complete read copy in another region, there will be no data loss. If we set up a backup every 1 hour, the minimum RPO will be 1 hour.
